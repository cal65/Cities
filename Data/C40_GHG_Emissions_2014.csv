and New Jersey Transit (NJT) for its commuter rail and buses.
Data used to calculate fugitive and process CH4 and process N2O
from wastewater treatment were provided by DEP. CH4 emissions
were calculated based on the destruction of volatile material in
anaerobic digesters. Based on the measured concentration and
flow of volatile organic solids, it is estimated that 15 cubic feet of
digester gas is produced for every pound of volatile organic solids
destroyed. N2O emissions were calculated by applying the daily
nitrogen load discharged by each of the Cityâ€™s 14 wastewater
treatment plant to the formula in the LGOP.

Fugitive CH4 from in-city landfills was calculated from landfill gas
collection data provided by the New York City Department of Sani-
tation (DSNY) and DEP per the LGOP. Fugitive CH4 from exported
solid waste was calculated using waste disposal figures for resi-
dential, commercial, and construction and demolition waste and
applying emissions factors from the USCP, which were taken from
EPAâ€™s Waste Reduction Model (WARM). Fugitive CH4 from natural
gas distribution was calculated using data provided by National
Grid and ConEd. Fugitive SF6 from electricity distribution was cal-
culated using data provided by ConEd. 

All DSNY-managed municipal solid waste (residential and some
institutional solid waste) generated in New York City is exported to 
landfills by private contractor and waste-to-energy facilities by
DSNY. Fuel consumed by trains and trucks exporting solid waste
out of the city is calculated using data provided by DSNY detailing
the mass of waste transported, mode of transport, and distance
to each disposal facility. Fuel use was calculated by estimating
how many trucks and trains are needed to transport the waste,
and applying average fuel economy figures to the weighted aver-
age distance to receiving landfills.

Scope 3 aviation emissions were calculated using fuel use data
from the PANYNJ. Emissions coefficients in the LGOP were applied
to the total volume of jet fuel and aviation gasoline loaded onto
airplanes at LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy airports, as modeled

These GHG protocols used in the 2010 Regional GHG Inventory are listed below, and were applied to each sector, as relevant and as discussed below for each emissions sector. 

The LGOP for Greenhouse Gas Assessments developed by ICLEI, CAR, TCR and CARB (California Air Resources Board 2010a): This protocol includes methods for estimating emissions resulting from government buildings and facilities, government fleet vehicles, wastewater treatment and potable water treatment facilities, landfill and composting facilities, and other operations. This protocol was developed primarily for use by California local governments; although it contains methodologies for estimating emissions pertinent to community emissions sources. Further, this protocol can be modified for use outside of California, although in some cases, data sources or other references may need to be modified accordingly to local conditions or constraints.

The USEPA Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990â€“2007 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2009a): The national inventory documentation includes standard methodology and emission factors for nationwide GHG emissions inventorying. 

The IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2006a): This document is the international standard for inventories and provides much of the baseline methodology used in the national and statewide emission inventories. 

The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard developed by WRI and the WBCSD (World Resources Institute 2004): Although this is a protocol designed for use primarily by private corporations, it was one of the first documents to establish the principles and steps to developing a GHG inventory. This document has influenced the development of other types of GHG protocols, including those for municipal, government, and community-wide emissions.

Emissions are commonly divided into three categories or â€œscopesâ€ù, as follows (World Resources Institute 2004):
Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions, such as emissions from combustion of natural gas or in vehicles, where the emission occurs directly at the activity causing the emission.
Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions, such as emissions associate with the consumption of electricity due to power plant emissions or methane emissions at a landfill that receives waste, where the emissions occur at a location separate from the activity causing the emission.

Scope 3: All other indirect emissions not covered in Scope 2 that are not owned or controlled by the reporting jurisdiction, such as the emissions resulting from the extraction and production of purchased materials and fuels.

Stockholm includes the greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N2O in the yearly inventory of CO2e emission within the community boundary.

Scope 3 defined as the life cycle emissions of the energy use):
â€¢	scope 1 and 3 emissions from district heating and cooling system and other in-boundary fuel combustion for heating
â€¢	scope 2 and 3 emissions of the house-hold electricity consumption within the community boundary
â€¢	scope 1 and 3 emissions of use of gas for e.g. cooking
â€¢	scope 2 and 3 emissions for electricity use in the transportation system (metro, commuter train and train) within the community boundary
â€¢	scope 1 and 3 emissions for the fuel consumption from road traffic, non-road vehicles and shipping, and scope 1 emissions from aviation (within the landing and take-off cycle, i.e. up to 915m).

This means that scope 3 emissions from transportation of Stockholmers outside the community boundary is not included (but transportation of non-Stockholmers within the community boundary is included). Emission from household waste incineration is embedded in the district heating emissions, since household waste is one source of energy used in district heating. Energy use for waste-water handling is included in the total community energy use.

Emission factors are collected from a report published by Swedish Environmental Research Institute Ltd. (IVL) in 2001 and Thermal Engineering Research Institute (VÃ_rmeforsk) in 2011. The reports are widely used and acknowledged in Sweden. The global warming potentials are GWP100 from IPCC 2007, as recommended by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA).

Energy statistics are collected from different sources. District heating and gas statistics are collected from the companies in charge, electricity statistics is compiled at, and collected from, Statistics Sweden. Emission from road transport is modelled using an extensive emission model combined with a road model over Stockholm, so that a large variety of vehicles, speeds, road types etc. are included. Non-road vehicle statistics derives from Statistics Sweden, marine emissions within the community boundary are based on emissions and energy use presented in environmental reports from shipping companies and Stockholm Hamnar (Ports of Stockholm), and further elaborated to account for the community of Stockholm only.

Meanwhile , the population has grown by about 200 000 inhabitants. In Stockholm, it can be said that the reduction in per capita emissions by half will depend on the actual response , half of the population growth .

The 2013 follow-up of greenhouse gas emissions in Stockholm is estimated at 3.0 tonnes per capita in 2012. The estimates are preliminary and based on forecasted values. Calculated values for the 2011 greenhouse gas emissions, based on available statistics and modeling, is 3.2 tonnes per capita .
Energy use for heating has decreased in 2012, which is probably due to energy efficiency measures and conversions ( from oil to heat pumps). Stockholm has a clear reduction of the energy supply per capita for heating sector. The use of gas in the city decreases. Electricity use is however quite constant. There has been a large reduction in car traffic and a slight increase in the share of light trucks.
In the category of passenger cars have petrol car proportion dropped in favor of gas and ethanol cars, but most of all diesel cars. Diesel passenger cars consist increasingly of environmentally rated efficient diesel cars. Along with the decrease in transport activity ,this leads to strong overall emission reductions in the transport sector.

The methodology for its preparation was divided into different stages: 

-Obtaining selected information. 
-Processing of the received data 
-The conclusions drawn from this process. 

In order to obtain the correct information, the EPA identified the different sectors to be included in the inventory and selected the accurate data to calculate GHG emissions. When the bodies responsible for providing the necessary information were identified, the data was requested. 

When organizing information, the information was given a hierarchical order as follows: 
-Field (I.e. Community) 
-Sector (I.e. energy consumption) 
-Category (I.e. Power consumption) 
-Sub category (I.e. Power consumption for residential). 
To represent the GHG emissions produced within the Community sector the following categories were selected:

1. Energy consumption
2. Transport
3. Waste (Scope 3)
4. Water treatment (Scope 3)

1. Energy consumption
This category includes electricity, natural gas and diesel consumption. It is divided in 3 sub-categories: residential, commercial and industrial.

2. Transport
This category includes different means of transport, both private and public, which were considered representative at the time of accounting GHG emissions.

Private transport:
-Private cars (including vans), taking into consideration the kind of fuel used: gasoline, diesel or natural gas.
-Duty traces (light and heavy), taking into consideration the kind of fuel used: gasoline, diesel or natural gas.

Public transport:
-Buses, with diesel engines
-Taxis, including diesel and natural gas
-Subway, operating through electric power
-Trains, including those running with electric power as well as those using diesel engines.

3. Waste (Scope 3)
This category includes the amount of Municipal Solid Waste generated (taking into consideration residential and urban solid waste) in Buenos Aires during the reporting year, as well as its composition.
-food waste
-Pruning and garden waste
-Wood
-Textile
-Paper and cardboard
-Glass, plastic, metal and others.

4. Water treatment (Scope 3)
This category includes de energy consumed (KWh) for treating and providing drinkable water to the City. 

The data was processed and GHG emissions were calculated and converted to carbon dioxide equivalent using information on energy consumption (fuel, natural gas, electricity) for activities, emission factor, calorific power and density of energy used.

For the community inventory, the methodology used in the Energy Sector was the one used for the Government operation inventory. That is, stating the KWh/year consumed by the 3 sub categories, and multiplying by the emission factor of the grid. As for gas consumption, m3 of gas consumed, calorific power of natural gas, density of the gas and its emissions factor (IPCC 2006 default) were considered in the equation. 

For the private transport sector and buses, GHG emissions were calculated taking into consideration, for each sub categories within the sector, the amount of circulating cars by type of fuel consumed and the amount and type of fuel sold in the city. Fuel consumed by industries and governmentâ€™s fleet was subtracted to the amount of fuel sold leaving amount of fuel consumed by vehicles.

For the other public transport sector, trains and subways, GHG emissions were calculated from electricity and diesel consumed when travelling within the City. Kilometers travelled and energy consumption data was obtained from the National Regulatory Commission of transport, and MetrovÃ_as (Subway grant company). 

For the Waste sector, the methodology used was one developed by the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC), â€œTool to determine methane emissions avoided from disposal of waste at a solid waste of disposal siteâ€ù. In order to apply this methodology, it was necessary to obtain both the amount of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generated in the City of Buenos Aires in each of the years considered in the inventory, as well as their composition.

2) Calculation: 
Considering 2006 IPCC G/L as standard methodology, Seoul has applied domestic activity and basic Emission Factors of the guideline for calculation as well as basic city data (energy consumption, waste, etc.). Emissions of 6 major greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6) stated in the Kyoto Protocol were calculated and Seoul applied Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) from the second Assessment Report from the IPCC. 

3) Classification of emission source: 
In large, the classification is based on the 2006 IPCC G/L classification system but the categories were integrated or specified according to the characteristics of the city of Seoul. Based on the range of Seoul's authority, emission sources were classified into Scope 1 (Direct emission) and Scope 2 (Indirect emission), in accordance with the local GHG calculation guidelines.  

4) Measurement: 
Activities are collected from the official statistics of the national government and are used as activity for calculation of greenhouse gas emissions by sector. Official statistics provided by the national government are released every year and include oil statistics, electricity statistics, and chronology regional energy statistics. Emission calculations such as Emission Factor, are mainly based on the IPCC Guideline.

Residential/Commercial/Industrial/Direct Access Electricity: 
The majority of electricity used by the Residential, Commercial and Industrial sectors of San Francisco is purchased from PG&E. Exceptions to this are power to municipal operations, which is provided by the San Francisco Public Utility Commission (detailed in the Municipal Inventory guidance), and the remaining Direct Access power customers.

Data is provided by PG&E and the SFPUC. Emissions from electricity are calculated by applying each electricity sourceâ€™s unique carbon profile to the total MWhâ€™s consumed by each supplierâ€™s customers.

Residential/Commercial/Industrial and Municipal Natural Gas: 
The residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal sectors of San Francisco purchase their natural gas from PG&E. Data is provided by both PG&E and the SFPUC. The California Climate Action Registry stationary combustion natural gas emissions factor is applied to the activity data to determine tons of GHGs. The emission factor for natural gas is based on combustion only and does not include upstream methane leakage from extraction and distribution of natural gas.

Municipal Electricity (including MUNI fleet electricity): 
Electricity usage data for municipal operations is obtained from the SFPUC. The electricity EF is provided by the SFPUC and applied to the usage data to determine the CO2 emissions.

Intra-regional & SF Road Vehicles: 
All vehicle related VMT have been consolidated into one report.  SFCTA provides modeled VMT data from their SFCHAMP model that includes all trips made by passenger vehicles and trucks within San Francisco and assigns half of the VMT associated with trips into or outside of SF.  The other half is attributed to the source or destination city per MTC guidance.  Pass-thru VMT are excluded from the total.  This methodology follows MTC guidance.  Daily VMT are multiplied by 330 to account for total weighted annual VMT where weekend demand is less than weekday. The 2010 CHAMP model did not include emissions from buses or freight. 
CO2e emissions are provided by the Bay Air Area Quality Management District using the Air Resource Boardâ€™s EMFAC model database.  The emission factor varies by year based on fleet composition used in the model from the DMV and modeling assumptions.

The emission factors vary by year and were supplied by the Bay Air Area Quality Management District. They were derived using EMFAC.

Rail â€“ Caltrain Diesel Fuel: 
Estimates on total system fuel usage are obtained as well as passenger data, specifically total ridership and number of de-boardings in San Francisco. The percentage of trips de-boarding in San Francisco is share of trips attributable to San Francisco. This percentage is then applied to the total fuel usage, and that amount of fuel is multiplied by the California Climate Action Registry CO2 factor for diesel from mobile sources to determine emissions.
 
Rail â€“ BART Electricity: 
In order to estimate emissions from BART attributable to San Francisco market area, data and total system power consumption was obtained from BART staff. Transbay and Westbay ridership was considered attributable to San Francisco and was divided by total ridership to determine a market share % for San Francisco. This market share % was than multiplied by total system power usage to determine the San Francisco share of power usage. The total system power data is based on electric propulsion data from: http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm. Emissions factor data is available from PG&E and is commonly published in internal/external reports on energy or GHG emissions.
  
Ferry â€“ Diesel Fuel: 
Ferry data is an estimation of emissions from all Bay Area leisure and commuter ferries. Starting in 2009, the data for all 3 agencies included in SFâ€™s inventory (City of Alameda, City of Vallejo, and Golden Gate Bridge, Highway, and Transportation District) is reported at: http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm.  Mode type is â€˜FBâ€™.

This method shows only the total amount of carbon dioxide emitted in the city but it does not include the impact of external electricity trade. Therefore, the consumption of final energy consumers is not reflected. That is why Berlin prefers method (2) which is a consumption-based accounting of CO2 emissions.

It also adds to the end-usersâ€™ emissions those produced by generation of electricity and district heating in the energy transformation sector. Consumption-based accounting of CO2 emissions is therefore one indicator to find out the end-usersâ€™ emissions in a region.

The LGOP employs the convention of categorizing local government emission sources as Scope 1
(direct), Scope 2 (indirect), and Scope 3 (other indirect). Although the LGOP is geared towards
municipal inventories, these same scope definitions apply to community inventories. The LGOP
defines these emissions as follows (California Air Resources Board et al. 2010).

sources);
ïÅ¬ Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions associated with the consumption of purchased or acquired

In general, the methodology follows guidelines developed by ICLEI â€” Local Governments for Sustainability and uses the Clean Air and Climate Protection software developed jointly by ICLEI and STAPPA/ALAPCO.
 
This inventory is for all of Multnomah County. The City of Portland is 79% of Multnomah County by population. The inventory includes all emissions associated with electricity, natural gas, fuel oil (distillate and residual), propane, gasoline, diesel and solid waste disposal. These sources are discussed in further detail below.

Electricity is provided to customers in Multnomah County by Portland General Electric (PGE) and Pacific Power (PP). Both PGE and PP provide data on the number of kilowatt-hours (kWh) sold to their distribution customers in each of three sectors: residential, commercial and industrial. Because these total numbers include sales of â€œgreen powerâ€ù (i.e., power generated from sources that do not emit carbon emissions) to customers who have elected to purchase such power, these numbers are adjusted to determine how many kWh were sold to customers in Multnomah County from the utilitiesâ€™ standard sources. To calculate the carbon emissions from grid power, the inventory uses emission factors provided by ICLEI for the Northwest Power Pool of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council.

NW Natural, the sole natural gas utility for Multnomah County, provides data on the total therms used in the county by the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. The carbon emissions attributable to natural gas usage are calculated by multiplying the total number of therms by the conversion factor provided by ICLEI for converting therms to CO2-e. 

Fuel oil data are taken from the U.S. Energy Information Administrationâ€™s â€œAnnual Fuel Oil and Kerosene Sales Reportâ€ù contained in the Petroleum Supply Annual (EIA Report), which publishes data on the sales in Oregon of heating oil, propane and kerosene. Figures are broken down in the three residential, commercial and industrial customer classes. In the absence of more specific information about usage in Multnomah County, the inventory assigns the county a share based on the percent of Oregonâ€™s population living in Multnomah County. ICLEI provides conversion factors for carbon emissions associated with each of these heating fuels. The carbon emissions from these fuels attributable to Multnomah County are calculated by multiplying the total amount of each fuel by the applicable conversion factor.

Emissions from gasoline are calculated based on the number of gallons of gasoline sold in Multnomah County. The State of Oregon, which collects a county gas tax on behalf of Multnomah County, issues quarterly reports detailing the total gallons of gasoline sold in the county. Gasoline sales provide an imperfect measure, since clearly some people who drive in Multnomah County purchase gasoline outside of the county while others purchase it in the county but drive elsewhere. 

The EIA Report contains data for the sales in Oregon of diesel fuel and certain other transportation fuels used for rail, shipping, on-highway use, military uses and off -highway use. Because of the interstate and international character of air, rail and shipping, ICLEI recommends not attributing fuel used by these modes to a given locality, and the inventory excludes these. The inventory allocates to Multnomah County a share of Oregonâ€™s total sales of diesel for on-highway and construction use according to population. 

Metro, the regional government for the Portland area, operates the solid waste transfer stations serving Multnomah County and provides data on the total tonnage of materials landfilled each year from the Metro region. The inventory assigns a share of the total tonnage to Multnomah County based on the percent of Metro population that is in Multnomah County. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) conducts studies to determine the composition of waste in Oregon landfills. Thus, it is possible to estimate the composition of waste buried in landfills that are attributable to Multnomah County.

Some landfills capture methane gas and flare it. For each landfill that receives waste from Metro, DEQ provides an estimate of the percentage of methane captured.
