# Cities
This project is an exploration on quantifying cities. 

There are more efforts now to explore city metrics. I am trying to discover more unusual cultural and lifestyle metrics that help shape how people in a city lives. I have never seen someone approach cities this way.

Part of the project is simply gathering data from disparate sources. The core of the data originates from http://www.worldcitiescultureforum.com/data who have many interesting cultural metrics covering 25-30 cities. This data is a great starting point but far from consistent or comprehensive.

My main goal is to applying statistical clustering to discover different types of cities. The possible permutations of clusters is endless depending on which metrics are included, but my first goal is to attempt to identify continental clusters, without applying any sort of geographical input. Are there metrics that distinguish Asian cities from European cities from North American cities?
